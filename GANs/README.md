# Generative Model

A Generative model describes algorithms that can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos. 
Recent breakthroughs in the field have the potential to drastically change the way we approach content creation.
(Ex. Chat-GPT)

# GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were developed in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow and his teammates. 
GANs is basically an approach to generative modeling that generates a new set of data based on training data that look like training data. 
GANs have two main Components(two neural networks or models) called "Generator" and "Discriminator" which compete with each other and are able to capture, copy, and analyze the variations in a dataset.

GANs can be separate in three parts as follow :

* Generative – To learn a generative model, which describes how data is generated in terms of a probabilistic model. In simple words, it explains how data is generated visually.
* Adversarial – The training of the model is done in an adversarial setting.
* Networks – use deep neural networks for training purposes.


# About the Work

This work has been realised by 5 peoples, all student at *African Master in Machine Intelligence* (AMMI), Senegal; In context of Fondations of Deep Learning course.
